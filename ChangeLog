Version 1.03, February 08, 2018
- renamed SymbolList.bas file to Symbols.bas
- removed data statements from Symbols.bas
- added file SymbolData.bas which contains the FB symbols in data statements 
- updated symbols list to what I think is a complete list
- converted data statements to lowercase and changed code to reflect that (and hopefully improve speed)
- added get_item(index) function in TList
    This function starts at the null node and iterates index times and returns that node.
    Mostly useful for debugging
